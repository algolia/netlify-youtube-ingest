# Netlify function to index YouTube videos on Algolia

This is a quick script to index (or just grab JSON) for youtube videos.

## Requirements

* [Algolia account](https://algolia.com/signup?utm_source=social&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=devrel_youtube&utm_id=integrations) with an app ID
* [YouTube Developers API Key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)

## Quick Deploy

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/brob/netlify-youtube-ingest)


Use the "Deploy to Netlify" Button above. It will ask you for some environment variables:

* YouTube API key
* Algolia App ID
* Algolia Search API key
* Algolia Admin API key (for writing to the index)
* Algolia Index name (if the index doesn't exist, the function will create it)

After the first deploy, hit the `/.netlify/functions/getYoutubeJson` endpoint with a `channelId`, `maxResults`, and `index=true` query parameters (detailed below). This will index the most recent `n` videos for the channel provided (where `n` is the `maxResults` value).

Once indexed, the frontend for this microsite will work (or you can use the index elsewhere). 

To keep the index fresh, you'll want to create a way to index new content. In [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com), you can set up a "[New YouTube video by channel](https://ifttt.com/youtube/triggers/new_video_by_channel)" trigger that can fire a webhook action to the `/.netlify/functions/getYoutubeByUrl` function and provide the new video's URL as the `videoUrl` parameter with `index=true`. For every new video, your index will be updated.

By default, these functions will scrape the following details:

* Title
* Description
* Tags
* Video Id (as objectID)
* Comment Count
* Likes
* Favorites
* Views

You can use all of this information as ranking and sorting inside your [Algolia dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard) and customize the search results.

## Installation

In your Netlify project, create (or use) your Netlify functions directory. If you don't have one, create a new directory:

```sh
mkdir /netlify/functions
```

Put the contents of `netlify/functions/getYoutube.js` into this directory.

Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install algoliasearch axios dotenv
```

To run locally, use [the Netlify Dev CLI](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/).

```sh
netlify dev
```

### Environment variables

The function requires environment variables to connect to the YouTube API and an Algolia index.

|variable|use|
|--------|---|
|`YOUTUBE_KEY`| Your API Key for [the YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)|
|`ALGOLIA_APP_ID`| The Algolia app ID |
|`ALGOLIA_API_KEY`| Your Algolia API key. This needs write permissions to write to the index |
|`ALGOLIA_SEARCH_KEY`| Your Algolia search-only key to power the frontend |
|`VIDEO_INDEX`| The Index name where your search index will be stored in Algolia |
 
## Usage

After installation, you'll have access to the following endpoints on your Netlify site:

`/.netlify/functions/getYoutubeJson`
`/.netlify/functions/getYoutubeByUrl`
## Parameters 

### `getYoutubeJson

```sh
/.netlify/functions/getYoutubeJson
        ?channelID=<your channel id>
        
        &maxResults=<number of results>
        
        &index=<true/false to index>
```

|parameter|type|what it does|
|---|----|---|
| `channelId` | `string` | The ID of the YouTube channel to scrape |
| `maxResults` | `string` | How many results to return (this is ordered by date, so it will get "latest" `n` videos) |
| `index` | `boolean` | if `true` will submit the videos in the list to Algolia (using env variables) if `false` will just display JSON in the body of the response

### `getYoutubeByUrl`

This endpoint is mostly intended to be used with an IFTTT Applet. IFTTT has a Trigger action that is for new YouTube video on a channel. When there's a new video, it can then fire a webhook to this endpoint and provide the URL for the video. The endpoint then gets the video ID from the video and indexes the video content and id.

|parameter|type|what it does|
|-------|----|------|
|`videoUrl` | `string` | The URL to the youtube video (this is the way to get it in IFTTT). This will be used to get the ID of the video|
| `index` | `boolean` | if `true` will submit the videos in the list to Algolia (using env variables) if `false` will just display JSON in the body of the response |
